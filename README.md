# nondeterminism

Python 3 library for writing nondeterministic algorithms.

See hamiltonian.py for a sample nondeterministic algorithm.

This library is mostly designed for teaching purposes (providing executable pseudocode for nondeterministic algorithms), and is not suitable for production code (the implementation is based on fork(2), so currently this code only runs on Unix, and is not optimised).
